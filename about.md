### Research Data Engineer | Open Source | Data Exchange Standards

I'm a Research Data Engineer working part-time at CDISC. I blog about open-source software, data exchange standards, 
clinical research informatics, and other largely technical topics.

At CDISC I co-lead the Data Exchange Standards team, advise leadership on strategy, and contribute technical 
leadership to 360i, COSA, CORE, and CDISC Library. I formerly served as the CDISC VP of Data Science for over 10 
years, and I've been a volunteer for the Data Exchange Standards team since the early days. I've held 
several senior-level technology positions during my 30+ years working in the biopharmaceutical industry. 

I'm an active PHUSE contributor and some of my papers will make there way onto my blog. I typically post them here
before I publish them elsewhere.
